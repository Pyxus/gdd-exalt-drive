# General

- [ ] A lot of anime fighters have weird, sometimes seemingly nonsensical, announcements before the battle starts. As odd as they seem I kind of like them. I want such an announcement but related to the game's themes.
	- Examples: [Guilty Gear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6WcKA5DSb4) | [Cross Tag Battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLlImT5eEbw) | [BlazBlue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoXcEbOM9s)
	- "Progress demands a relentless heart. Doubt and resolve clash in the crucible of adversity. Exalt your drive! Let the duel commence!"
	- "Actualize your potential. Be delusional."
	- "Do these excuses bring comfort, or do they just keep you stuck, feeling justified in your current circumstances?"
	- "Limiting beliefs are the subconscious thoughts that restrict our ability to achieve"
- [ ]  When a player reads that someone initiated a clash defensively and choose to do nothing they're able perform an uncontested clash in return. This could be called Yomi (FGC/JP Term that means Reading).
- [ ]  When a drive link is performed it could be called Rengeki (JP for combo attack). This is a reference to one of my favorite games [.hack//gu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imq8cvOBDqU). 

# Characters

- [ ]  **Rohan Jett:** 
	- **Power:** Slip & Slide: Allows him to increase and decrease the friction of a target.
	- **Playstyle:** Could be a tricky character who messes with board spaces to limit the opponent's movement.
	- **Design:** Black man; 6'3''; Muscular build; 
	- **Drawing:** *Character has yet to be drawn*
	- **Personality:** Extremely eccentric; Has the motto of "Good Vibes"
- [ ]  Nero:
	- **Power:** Stage play: Is able to  designate an area as a "stage" forcing all within to become actors. These actors will slowly have their own personality overwritten by the characters they're assigned. The more actors take actions that align with their characters the faster the synchronization occurs until the original person is lost. Despite their power Nero rarely uses it in combat as it isn't very suitable for a fight. They prefer to crush their opponent with raw power rather than go through the hassle of setting up their ability.
	- **Playstyle:** Power type; Each move is a quick and powerful strike but the trade off is lackluster defense options.
	- **Design:** Olive skin man; 6' 6'';  Slim Muscular Build; Dresses in Drag
	- [**Drawing**](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cn7UFy2OUA1/?img_index=1): Drawn but design is outdated.
	- **Personality:** Arrogant and condescending; Playfully assertive
- [ ]  Evelyn Ead:
	- **Power:** Will of The World: Allows her to tangentially apply a force or impulse to any targets in the path of intangible threads she can manifest.
	- **Playstyle:** Unique/Shooting type; She fights mainly by applying forces from a distance
