# Biography

# Background

Hanami Nami is a highly skilled operative within **WATCHR**(Weiss Aberrant Threat Control and Hazard Reduction), a subsidiary of the Weiss Agency that specializes in investigating, retrieving, and subduing aberrations at the behest of Weiss and their clients. Weiss, primarily a company dedicated to researching and developing aberrant tools, oversees the operations of WATCHR.

## Appearance

Manami is a young woman with light peach skin and sharp, dark brown eyes. She sports long, dark hair typically tied into a bun and featuring two large strands cascading down to her chest. A long rest tassel wraps around the bun, reaching to her waist. Atop her head, she wears a large camellia and two bells, positioned next to large circular locks of hair.

As a WATCHR agent, Nami wears a loosely-fitted black suit jacket over a disheveled light-pink dress shirt. The shirt is partially buttoned, revealing her neck and part of her chest. A loosely-worn red tie with stiches and a Handler insignia clipped on hangs around her neck. On her left arm, a black armband with golden stripes signifies her rank, and her WATCHR ID is clipped to the left side of her chest. She opts for black suit pants secured by a belt with a golden snake buckle, paired with plain brown office shoes. Pink-tinted glasses with a golden frame grace her face, and two small silver piercings adorn her ears.

Nami's figure, aside from her large bust, leans towards a somewhat masculine physique with relatively small hips.

## Personality

At first glance, Manami appears to exude a serious and emotionally detached demeanor, particularly when confronted with combat situations. This is in part due to her past as a fixer for a local gang syndicate, a role she assumed when she was just a child. However, beneath this exterior, she possesses a genuinely easygoing and laid-back nature. Often, she finds herself teasing co-workers and expressing a flippant attitude towards all aspects of work not directly tied to her assignments. Manami holds within her a deep well of warmth and compassion, which she selectively reserves to those nearest and dear to her. In their presence, she sheds her guarded exterior, revealing a playful and nurturing disposition that few have the privilege of witnessing.

## Abilities and Equipment

**Alice's Eye of Query:** Allows her to query information about any object she looks at so long as the information is inherent to the object or able to be derived.

**Absent Butter Knife:** A changdao sword with an aberrant property that allows it to cut through anything with ease. In truth the blade is rather dull and incapable of cutting from a physical perspective. However, it's aberration causes it to erase anything that comes in contact with its cutting edge. It is unknown where the erased material goes.

**Aberrant Kiseru**: An aberrant Kiseru which indefinitely produces a vapor that can be shaped at will. The vapor constructs aren't very story but they can make for good distractions.
