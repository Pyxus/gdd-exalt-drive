# Biography

# Background
*Provide a concise background story for the character. Highlight key events or experiences that have shaped who they are.*

## Appearance

Ximena possesses a slender, petite frame with a distinctive, gaunt-like silhouette. Her deep olive skin is accentuated by a somewhat pale complexion. Long, pink hair frames her face, tightly wrapped on both sides, forming horn-like protrusions that split into two parts, cascading down to her waist with frayed ends. Her striking pink eyes, adorned with long eyelashes and thick pink eyebrows, are complemented by a thinly applied cherry red mascara drawn to a sharp point. A noticeable mole below and above her right eye adds to her unique features, while faint bags under her eyes contribute to a somewhat gloomy or exhausted appearance.

For attire, Ximena dons a lantern sleeve demi crop jacket, dark on the exterior and bright gold on the inside. A thin brassiere covers her chest, featuring a prominent black heart formed by interlocking hands, with a golden upside-down star at its center reminiscent of a reverse star tarot card. This heart serves as her source for drawing cards during battle. The rest of her torso remains exposed. Dark cargo pants with shoulder straps and a chain belt, adorned with a golden buckle inscribed with the word "Ergo," complete her ensemble.

## Personality

Ximena comes across as a kind, wise, and unassuming woman who often seems lost in thought, yet remains acutely aware of her surroundings. Even when gazing into space, she appears to be privy to some exclusive insight. Her silly and playful nature, combined with her sleepy eyes and peculiar expressions, adds to her uncanny charm. Despite this slightly eerie demeanor, she never displays negative emotions like anger or sadness, and her overall presence remains non-threatening.

Ximena has an insatiable thirst for understanding humanity. Despite her vast knowledge from countless fables, she struggles to connect emotionally with others. Often, she seems emotionally detached or socially awkward, finding it challenging to interpret social cues, which makes her appear unusual in social settings. However, she remains unfazed by the discomfort others feel around her and, although she could use her knowledge to fit in more easily, she chooses to stay true to herself, seeing masking her true self and tantamount to death.

Ximena doesn't consider herself to have any enemies and doesn't believe in acting out of malice or casting judgement on others. She frequently offers genuinely helpful life advice even to those who claim to be in conflict with her.  In fact, patience, empathy, and kindness form the foundation of her principles as she considers all people worthy of understanding and seeks to empathize with saints and sinners alike. While many would view these traits as virtuous, Ximena takes it to an unsettling extreme. In her view people act to realize their ideal worlds and therefore conflict is just the natural consequence of incompatible pursuits. Ximena wouldn't save a person being attacked as that is just the attacker manifesting their ideal, likewise she wouldn't save the attacker from being executed as that is society manifesting another ideal. Sticking to this belief she herself only entertains conflict when one interrupts her own ideal pursuit. To her predators and prey don't need to respect one another, but they ought to understand each other's drives and when doing so they'll learn animosity is an unnecessary component of their dynamic.

In her intense pursuit of personal interests, she embodies a selfish and callous demeanor, displaying stark indifference to the suffering and consequences inflicted upon others. However, she makes no effort to justify her actions or highlight the 'good' in her goals. Instead, she simply acknowledges that she is a selfish person and readily accepts the label of evil, considering it a "reasonable conclusion" that others reach. Beyond this acceptance, Ximena is a frighteningly competent individual, swiftly dismantling any opposition with ruthless efficiency. Her cruelty takes on an almost casual quality, absent of a cold or emotionless veneer. On the contrary, she approaches most situations with a mix of awe and intrigue, audibly rolling her eyes and sighing when confronted with things that fail to capture her interest. Arguably the most menacing aspect of her character is how little she appears evil, even when surrounded by chaos.

## Abilities and Equipment

**Fabula del Ti:**  This ability enables the user to extract a person's identity or "fable" through touch, manifesting as a unique card adorned with imagery reflective of the target's identity. Each fable encapsulates a person's thoughts, experiences, abilities, and characteristics. These extracted fable cards can be inserted into another person allowing them to gain the skills and traits associated with the inserted card. However, the process of extracting a fable immediately induces a state of shock in most individuals, coupled with an ego-death that strips them of their ability to retain memories or any semblance of self. The memory loss typically occurs when the afflicted loses consciousness, such as during sleep.

**Fighting Style:** Ximena's fighting style consists of rapid close quarters combat where she employs capoeira and open hand karate techniques in attempts to make contact with her opponent with either her hands or feet in order make use of her fable extraction ability. She also uses this opportunity to preserve her energy while sizing up her opponents before going for a more lethal approach. Once she decides to use the full extent of her abilities her style evolves to make use of the various fable cards at her disposal.
