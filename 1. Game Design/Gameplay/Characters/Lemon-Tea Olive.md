# Biography

# Background
*Provide a concise background story for the character. Highlight key events or experiences that have shaped who they are.*

## Appearance

Lemon-Tea is a slim, petit young girl. She has mid-length dark blue hair that almost reaches her neck, with pink bangs in the front, and heart-shaped space bunts with pink hair at their center. Lemon has pink eyes, long eyelashes, and thick eyebrows the same color as her hair. On her ears she golden hoop earrings. She has olive colored skin with rosy cheeks and a face peppered with a few small moles.

Lemon's outfit consists of a black, front zip turtle neck sweater whose right sleeve is colored yellow from the cuff and 3/4 of the way to the shoulder. Over the sweater she wears a yellow vest jacket with a large chat shaped hole cut out at the center and a small purse attached to the right side. On her legs she wears a medium length brown skort with knee high cat socks and mary jane shoes.

During battle she dawns a large black robe with white edges, and a flesh-red underside. The robe features a yellow bow tie, and large yellow loops on her shoulder. On her head she wears a large black hat with fled-red underside similar to the robe.

## Personality

Lemon-Tea is a delicate and introverted girl, preferring the company of her pet ferret Fidget to that of others. In social situations, she tends to blend into the background, often hesitant to assert herself or speak up. Despite her timid nature, she possesses a playful and curious disposition, never ceasing to be amazed by things around her. She's known to strike poses as she acts like a superhero, revealing her youthful innocence and sense of wonder. However, her naivety is partly due to an aberration that continuously erases her memory whenever she sleeps.

When Lemon-Tea is confronted with danger or unfamiliar situations, she's prone to bouts of self-doubt and anxiety. But when she dons her witch's robe for combat, she becomes a stoic and focused warrior who makes quick and decisive decisions in the face of adversity. Her magic becomes a potent force to be reckoned with, as she taps into her inner strength and courage to overcome any obstacle. Despite her occasional moments of panic, Lemon-Tea is a capable and resourceful individual.
