| Roguelike Deckbuilder | 535        | $11,000       | Not current plan but this is a very popular genre and the scope could be expanded to include a roguelite mode |
| Turn-Based Strategy   | 4546       | $2,300        |                                                                                                               |

| Card Battler          | 1,624      | $960          | I wonder why card battler's income is so low compared to deck builder                                         |
