# Solo Sprint Workflow

At the start of each sprint period (1 week, 2 week, month, etc.)

1. Define a sprint milestone
	- A milestone is an outcome you desire that motivates you to action. A milestone without action is just a wish
	- This milestone should be **S.M.A.R.T**
		- **Specific:** Precise description of what is to be accomplished
		- **Measurable:** Progress is visible and tracked
		- **Attainable:** What actions are needed to make it happen
		- **Relevant:** Meaningful and realistic
		- **Timebound:** Estimated time for completion
2. Define task aid the milestone (task can be defined as issues arrise)
	- Task must also be **S.M.A.R.T**
	- Your milestone task should be **Important** not urgent. Important task lead you toward completion of the milestone. Urgent tasks are like distracting fires, they may be important in their own right but they lead you away from your milestone if you focus on extinguishing them.
	- **Remember**: Start where you are, use what you have, and do what you can. Your approach should be strategic.
1. Some time during each day of a sprint reflect on your progress (5-10 minutes).
	- Review: Take note of what you accomplished
	- Evaluate: Was today successful, if not what was blocking you?
	- Rehearse: What are you going to do address whatever was blocking you?
2. At the end of each sprint period perform a final reflection and plan the next period.
